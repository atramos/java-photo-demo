# photo-tools
This is a loose collection of code and utilities for working with digital photos, gathered from around the web.
I started pulling these into a central location for a personal project (ImageViewer). Where possible (and allowed by license) the collected code has been copied into here, to protect from relocation or disappearance. Some larger stuff is just linked.
